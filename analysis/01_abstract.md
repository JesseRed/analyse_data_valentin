## Abstract

### Background
Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT) performance is commonly summarized using endpoint metrics, which may miss clinically relevant learning dynamics. In post-stroke rehabilitation studies, intervention effects may emerge as changes in **how sequence-specific performance evolves over time**, rather than as a single static group difference. We therefore evaluated whether sequence-learning expression across two training days differed between intervention groups.

### Methods
We analyzed a two-day, two-group post-stroke SRTT dataset (Group A: VR+SRTT; Group B: SRTT-only). Behavioral logs were linked to participant metadata and reaction times (RT) were reconstructed trial-wise from cumulative within-block timestamps. Primary RT analyses used correct trials with plausibility filtering (150–3000 ms) and within-participant robust trimming (median +/- 3*MAD). The primary inferential model was a block-level linear mixed model on log-RT with fixed effects `Group x Day x Condition` (structured vs random), block number, and a minimal adjustment set (`Age`, `fuglmayrshort_sum`, `MoCa_sum`), plus participant random intercept. Planned contrasts (estimated marginal means) quantified simple effects. Secondary endpoint-style analyses used HC3-robust OLS on participant-day outcomes. Robustness checks included non-linear trajectory modeling, blue/green sequence decomposition, missingness/session-structure sensitivity, and permutation tests.

### Results
Data from 43 participants were available in metadata; 73 participant-day sessions were analyzed, with 34 participants contributing both days. Sequence-specific facilitation was robust in both groups (structured faster than random). In the primary mixed model, the key group-related finding was a significant `Group x Day x Condition` interaction (p=0.005), indicating different day-to-day evolution of the structured-random RT separation between groups. Planned contrasts showed that the structured advantage increased from day 1 to day 2 in Group A (about -5.6% to -9.3%), whereas it was relatively stable/slightly reduced in Group B (about -8.1% to -7.6%). Endpoint-style GLM analyses were weaker overall, although the minimally adjusted day-1 group main effect for `SeqLearning_Index_all` was nominally significant (coef 37.9 ms, 95% CI 0.4 to 75.4, p=0.048), with non-significant `Group x Day` interaction. Non-linear models fit better than linear slopes (likelihood-ratio p=0.007). Sensitivity analyses (119/120 block truncation and exclusion of the single long session) preserved direction and magnitude of group estimates.

### Conclusions
In this post-stroke SRTT dataset, the most robust intervention-related signal was **dynamic**: groups differed in the **day-by-condition evolution** of sequence-specific performance, not primarily in static endpoint differences. These findings support hierarchical, trajectory-aware modeling for rehabilitation motor-learning datasets and suggest that intervention effects may be better captured as changes in sequence-learning expression over time.
